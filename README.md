## How to Play

2. **Watch the Sequence**: The game will flash the first color in the sequence (e.g., blue). Pay attention!
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the colours in the exact order shown by the game.
4. **Advancing Levels**: Each round adds one new color to the sequence. You must remember and click the entire sequence in the correct order.
5. **Game Over**: If you click a color out of sequence, the game ends, and youâ€™ll need to start over.
